# Network-for-insider-trading-detection
The project constructs weighted edges between company insiders (nodes) based on the similarity of their trades over the 10-year time frame. Trends that may be indicative of insider trading are then uncovered with reference to (a) connected components, (b) network centrality, and (c) anomalous egonets (i.e., sub-graphs within the network)
