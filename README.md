# Network-for-insider-trading-detection

This project was completed as part of the Data-driven Networks Class taught by Renaud Lambiotte at the Oxford Internet Institute.

**Abstract**

Identifying insider trading poses a significant challenge to regulatory bodies due to the complex and interconnected nature of financial markets. The following work uses empirically derived networks to address this challenge. It will leverage data on 2.9 million trades reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by company insiders (C-suite executives and board members) between 2014 and 2024. The proposed network constructs weighted edges between company insiders (nodes) based on the similarity of their trades over the 10-year time frame. Trends that may be indicative of insider trading are then uncovered with reference to (a) connected components, (b) network centrality, and (c) anomalous egonets (i.e., sub-graphs within the network). The results indicate that these methods can be used to detect pairs or clusters of insiders whose behaviour suggests insider trading and/or market manipulation.
